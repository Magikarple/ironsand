# Iron Sand

This project is intended to be a driving game that takes place on a barren post-apoc landscape.

### notice
As of typing this, you do have to add cannon.js and three.js to your install, after that it is simply a cube that can move around with procedural terrain created and culled as it. Default controls are WASD.
